            <p>Hi, I'm Jess!</p>
                <p>I hold a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Apparel Design and have a strong background in product development, having worked in equestrian apparel before transitioning to Pacific Headwear (now part of the Momentec family of brands). Currently, I serve as the Lead for Headwear Design and Product Development. In pursuit of expanding my skill set and career opportunities, I’m currently enrolled in a Full Stack Development Bootcamp, which aligns with my goal of transitioning into UX/UI design. Outside of my professional life, I’m a dedicated mom, wife, and hobby farm owner with a passion for the outdoors. When I’m not working or in class, you can find me tending to my garden, enjoying time with my daughter, or getting lost in a good book.</p>
